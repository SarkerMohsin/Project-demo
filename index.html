            <h3>[Mohsin Sarker: ~Web Developer]</h3>
            <p>Hi I'm Mohsin Sarker. As a professional web developer I am passionate to build modern,
              classic and authentic websites for personal and commercial ueses. The progress of my learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript has inpired me to expose
              the beauty of websites and the combination of these languages websites will be most attractive and modern with all necesseray interation.</p>
              <p>Everybody using internet now-a-days and everything is going toward cloud base. I am self-motivative and convinced to go futher with some knowledge of
              web languages. I am encouraged by other developer and motivated to be a web developer.</p>
              <p>I am graduated with business and accounting background. I have management knowledge that can be applied to any industry. I worked in quite few places
              as a customer assistant in a retail shop and a team member in a coffee shop. I can make good relationship with customer and able to help tham in demand.</p>
              <p>Web designing is one of the best choices I like. I feel like it's creative and combination of arts, design, building structures and organise things.
              This can be the best hobbies too.</p>
              <p>On top of that I have hobbies to Travel around the world. I think it's about discovering the new things, new places and new environments where we can learn, fun, share,
              gether, and gain. I think travelling itself is creative and arts.</p>
